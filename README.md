# Unexpected Tailwind CSS Behavior in Flex Container

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using Tailwind CSS classes within a flex container.  The divs within the flex container do not render as expected, resulting in layout issues.

## Bug Description

When applying Tailwind CSS classes to divs inside a flex container, the expected layout is not achieved. The divs do not display correctly, and their positioning and appearance deviate from the intended style.

## Solution

The issue was resolved by ensuring that the necessary flexbox configurations are correctly applied to parent and child elements.  This includes using the `flex` class for the parent container and potentially addressing other classes that might be interfering with the layout.
